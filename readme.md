# ASM PAINT

**ASM PAINT** is a simplified version of the popular drawing tool, Paint, designed in assembly language for the x86 16-bit architecture. This project emulates the basic functionalities of Paint within a DOS environment, using **DOSBox** for CPU emulation and **ASM Helper** (a tool provided by the instructor) to assist with development in assembly.

## Project Overview

The **ASM PAINT** project replicates basic features of painting software, allowing users to draw on a simple graphical interface. Developing this in assembly represents a challenge, especially in implementing basic graphics and controls in a 16-bit environment.

## Tools Used

- **ASM x86 16-bit**: Assembly language for developing the application.
- **DOSBox**: CPU emulator used to run and test the code in an environment simulating a 16-bit x86 processor.
- **ASM Helper**: Tool provided by the instructor to facilitate development and debugging in assembly.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install DOSBox**  
   Download and install DOSBox from [dosbox.com](https://www.dosbox.com/).

2. **Configure ASM Helper**  
   Follow the instructor's instructions to install and configure ASM Helper along with DOSBox.

3. **Run the Project**
   - Ensure the **ASM PAINT** files are in an accessible directory.
   - Use DOSBox to navigate to the project directory and run the assembly program.
